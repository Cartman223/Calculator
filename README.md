# Calculator
Building my own calculator from scratch using all the knowledge I've gained thus far

Issues: 
    1. typing a number after you get a result printed will concatenate the number with the result shown in the display;
    2. pressing an operator button after the result is calculated and printed immediately performs another calculation;
